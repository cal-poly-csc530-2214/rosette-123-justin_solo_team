# rosette work

What did I do? Well, I spent some time playing with rosette, then tackled problem 1, with classify.rkt. Then I worked on Tesitin's encoding for a while. I read through the given slides, read the wikipedia page, and looked at other papers mentioning it, just to try and understand it well. Eventually, I did a practice problem based on an example given by wikipedia, which can be found in the file '2pt1.jpg'. Then I did number 2; the solution for which can be found in the file '2pt2.jpg'.
